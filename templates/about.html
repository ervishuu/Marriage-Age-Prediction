  <p style="font-size:16px;color:#fff9c4;" >People have different views when it comes to age difference between husband and wife.
       For instance, some people are of the opinion that a man who is way older than his wife will earn more respect from her,
    while some will consider the idea as irrelevant.</p>

<p style="font-size:16px;color:#fff9c4;">
It’s said age is just a number but when it comes to the matters of love and relationship, the age difference between a
    couple can actually impact their married life. Yes, you read it right! A recent study has linked the age difference between
    a couple with their chances of getting a divorce. In case, you are looking for a prospective life partner, this research might be of some help

<h5 style="color:#b9f6ca;">The study has an answer</h5>
<p style="font-size:16px;color:#fff9c4;">
A study from Emory University in Atlanta indicated the ideal age difference for a marriage to last and this data,
    collected after evaluating 3,000 participants, also revealed some interesting findings on divorce, kids and relationships.

Couples with five to ten years of age gap</h5>
<p style="font-size:16px;color:#fff9c4;">
Couples with five years of age gap were 18 per cent more likely to get divorced than the ones with a one-year age gap, which had just 3 per cent chances of calling it quits.
    The probability of having a divorce increases to 39 per cent for couples having a 10 year age difference.

    <p style="font-size:16px;color:#fff9c4;">
As for me, age difference is very important. I don’t think I would want to marry someone younger than me or my age mate for reasons best known to me. However, in my opinion,
    the maximum age difference I can consider for someone older than I am is a seven-year gap.
